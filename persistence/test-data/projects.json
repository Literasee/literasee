		"report": "# Are results meaningful? \n## Considerations for drawing inferences from summary assessment results\n\n### Introduction\nOften education leaders review summary assessment results for the purpose of evaluating programs, practices, or policies.    A district superintendent, for example, may examine school level results from the annual state assessment and consider why the proficiency rates in eighth grade mathematics increased for some schools in her district but were flat for many others.   In such circumstances, it is natural to form hypotheses about the findings.  For example, did the teachers in the schools experiencing the gains implement superior instructional practices compared to other schools?   In fact, it may seem reasonable to take this a step further consider how some tentative explanations could inform policy and practice.  For instance, should other schools adopt the curricular resources or teaching methods used in the more rapidly improving schools?  These are important questions with far-reaching implications.   Accordingly, the purpose of this essay is to review some key considerations to help education leaders determine whether summary assessment results should be used to support broader inferences.      \n\n### Essential Questions\n\nThere are three essential questions that can be used to frame an examination of the meaningfulness of summary assessment results.   \n-\u0009Is the outcome due to student achievement or something else?\n-\u0009Is the magnitude sufficient to be practically important?  \n-\u0009What factor(s) influenced the outcome?  \n\n#### Is the outcome due to student achievement?\n\nThe first question considers whether the finding is signal or noise.  All assessment results are noisy to some degree due to various sources of error.  One source of error is measurement error.  This refers to the extent to which the test from which the results derive is valid and reliable.  Another source is sampling error.  This refers to the extent to which the group of examinees who took the test can be thought to adequately represent the full population of potential examinees.  The best case to associate a finding with student achievement occurs when:\n-\u0009The test has a high degree of validity for the context and claim (e.g. proficiency) that is being examined. \n-\u0009The test has a high degree of precision for this claim.\n-\u0009The group of examinees on which the summary result is based is both large and representative of the population.  \n\nApart from measurement error and sample characteristics, there are a number of practical factors that may threaten a claim that results reflect student achievement.  For example, a claim that student achievement improved due to an annual increase in proficiency rate should be supported by strong evidence that the test is comparable to the form used in the previous year and that testing conditions remain consistent.   The test content may be similar and designed to be parallel across years, but if large numbers of students took the assessment on computer one year and paper the next, this change in mode complicates interpretation that results are due to student achievement alone.  \n\n#### Is the magnitude sufficient to be practically important?  \n\nOne can imagine a circumstance in which there is a high degree of confidence that findings are due to shifts in student achievement, but the magnitude of the finding is simply not large enough to be meaningful.  \n\nOften findings are evaluated with respect to ‘statistical significance,’ but this alone is insufficient to address whether the result is meaningful.  Statistical significance simply means the effect is very likely greater than zero in the population.   However, any non-zero value can be statistically significant particularly if the sample on which the result was based is large.  \nEffect sizes are a more conventional measure often used to evaluate magnitude.  An effect sizes expresses the outcome (e.g. increase in scale scores) in standard deviation units.     Effect sizes can be evaluated against thresholds based in the literature or from previous practice.  \n\n#### What factor(s) influenced the outcome?  \nThis question is by far the most challenging, because it relies on some degree of confidence in a causal statement. \n\nIn the best case – and some would say the only case – causal statements can only be supported when results come from a true experimental design.  A true experimental design involves randomly assigning participants into a treatment and control group and manipulating the independent variable.  For example, an experimental design to examine whether student achievement is higher for high schools on a block schedule compared to a traditional schedule, would involve:\n-\u0009Randomly assign a group of students to high schools based on schedule type\n-\u0009Establish clear and consistent conditions for the implementation of each type of schedule in all schools\n\nObviously, there are a host of ethical and practical reasons that make this type of study extremely difficult to implement in education.  It is more typical to evaluate assessment outcomes from conditions that occur naturally.  However, when assessment results are reviewed under these natural conditions, it is generally regarded as falling well short of the evidence required to support a causal claim. \n\nOther questions necessary to consider to support causal inferences include:\n-\u0009Is temporal precedence established?  For example, can one be certain that instructional impact occurred prior to improving student achievement as opposed to the gains in student achievement occurring before instruction?  \n-\u0009Is there an empirical relationship?  That is, the hypothesized cause is well correlated with the outcome.\n-\u0009Does manipulation of the hypothesized cause influence the outcome?  If one factor influences another, it stands to reason that increasing or decreasing that factor should have a corresponding impact on the outcome.  \n-\u0009Can rival conjectures be ruled out?  If there are other potential causes, sources of evidence such as those described in this section should be applied to confirm or rule out these hypotheses.\n-\u0009Are findings consistent with theory and expectation?  Finally, a causal claim should be consistent with a theory of action that can be well articulated and has a basis in research.  For example, if a particular instructional practice is thought to influence student achievement, that claim is strengthened by an established theory and research base that reveals this is a plausible claim that has been described and explained previously.       \n\n### Sources of Evidence\n\nWhen evaluating summary assessment results, a reasonable perspective may be to identify noteworthy findings that are good candidates for further examination.  These noteworthy findings become the basis for additional discussion and inquiry.  The following sources of evidence are suggested to provide a basis to identify findings that are more likely to be meaningful and can be prioritized as candidates for follow-up.\n-\u0009Findings are consistent across time (e.g. multiple years) \n-\u0009Findings are consistent within or across units (e.g. schools of various types, student subgroups)\n-\u0009Magnitude of effect is practically meaningful\n-\u0009Findings are not well correlated with factors that should not be related to student achievement (e.g. school size)\n-\u0009Findings can be corroborated with other source of trustworthy qualitative or quantitative evidence (e.g. schools with high academic achievement also recognized for accomplished educators)\n\nIn sum, drawing inferences from summary assessment results should be based on a pattern of evidence across time which can be corroborated with additional sources.  By so doing, hypothesis can be streamlined, refined, and prioritized, which provides a basis for more in-depth research in support of evidence to support policy or practice. \n\n",

Text emphasis is also supported in tables.\n\n```\n| Name | Description          |\n| ------------- | ----------- |\n| Help      | Display the help window.|\n| Close     | Closes a window     |\n| Email     | Initiate email window |\n| ~~Twitter~~   | ~~Tweet~~ |\n```\n\n| Name | Description          |\n| ------------- | ----------- |\n| Help      | Display the help window.|\n| Close     | Closes a window     |\n| Email     | Initiate email window |\n| ~~Twitter~~   | ~~Tweet~~ |\n\n---\n\n\n## Hypertext links\n\n```\n| Markdown | Result |\n|----------|--------|\n| ```[An inline-style link](http://literasee.io)``` | [An inline-style link](http://literasee.io)|\n| ```[An inline-style link with title](http://literasee.io \"Literasee Homepage\")``` | [An inline-style link with title](http://literasee.io \"Literasee Homepage\") |\n| ```[A reference-style link][Arbitrary case-insensitive reference text]``` | [A reference-style link][Arbitrary case-insensitive reference text] |\n| ```[A numbered reference-style link][1]``` | [A numbered reference-style link][1] |\n| ```[A relative reference to a repository file](../blob/master/LICENSE)``` | [A relative reference to a repository file](../blob/master/LICENSE) |\n\nURLs and URLs in angle brackets will automatically get turned into links. \nhttp://www.example.com or \u003chttp://www.example.com\u003e and sometimes \nexample.com (but not on Github, for example).\n\nSome text to show that the reference links can follow later.\n\n[arbitrary case-insensitive reference text]: https://www.nciea.org\n[1]: http://www.nciea.org\n```\n\n| Markdown | Result |\n|----------|--------|\n| ```[An inline-style link](http://literasee.io)``` | [An inline-style link](http://literasee.io)|\n| ```[An inline-style link with title](http://literasee.io \"Literasee Homepage\")``` | [An inline-style link with title](http://literasee.io \"Literasee Homepage\") |\n| ```[A reference-style link][Arbitrary case-insensitive reference text]``` | [A reference-style link][Arbitrary case-insensitive reference text] |\n| ```[A numbered reference-style link][1]``` | [A numbered reference-style link][1] |\n| ```[A relative reference to a repository file](../blob/master/LICENSE)``` | [A relative reference to a repository file](../blob/master/LICENSE) |\n\nURLs and URLs in angle brackets will automatically get turned into links. \nhttp://www.example.com or \u003chttp://www.example.com\u003e and sometimes \nexample.com (but not on Github, for example).\n\nSome text to show that the reference links can follow later.\n\n[arbitrary case-insensitive reference text]: https://www.nciea.org\n[1]: http://www.nciea.org\n\n---\n\n\n## Embedded images\n\nLiterasee logo embedded inline and reference (hover to see the title text):\n\n```\nInline-style: \n![alt text](https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/16685371?v=3\u0026s=200 \"Literasee logo\")\n\nReference-style: \n![alt text][logo]\n\n[logo]: https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/16685371?v=3\u0026s=200 \"Literasee logo\"\n```\n\nInline-style: \n![alt text](https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/16685371?v=3\u0026s=200 \"Literasee logo\")\n\nReference-style: \n![alt text][logo]\n\n[logo]: https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/16685371?v=3\u0026s=200 \"Literasee logo\"\n\n\n---\n\n## Embedded videos\n\nMarkdown doesn't directly support the inclusion of videos.
